Welcome!
========

This repository might have been called "re-MIDI" for several reasons:

- Re MIDI (Italian for "King MIDI") as a reference to King Midas?
- Do, Re... MIDI?
- re(mix) MIDI?
- re(view) MIDI?

Whatever. This is a (very) long-term experiment and workbench. The important thing to remember is: MIDI is not dead!

Soundfonts
==========

The soundfonts I use most often (for now) are ChoriumRevA, FluidR3 and Unison, but there are several resources such as www.hammersound.net where you can find a lot more.

How-To
======

Sooner or later I'll write this section too :-)
