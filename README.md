Lost in MIDI
============

Why is this repository called "re-MIDI"?

- Re MIDI (Italian for "King MIDI") as a reference to King Midas?
- Do, Re... MIDI?
- re(vive) MIDI?
- re(mix) MIDI?
- re(view) MIDI?

Whatever. This is a (very) long-term experiment and workbench, something I started as a kid which is now going somehow public. The important thing to remember is: MIDI is not dead!

Soundfonts
==========

The soundfonts I use most often (for now) are ChoriumRevA, FluidR3 and Unison, but there are several resources such as www.hammersound.net where you can find a lot more.

How-To
======

Sooner or later I'll write this section too :-)

I think a BY-NC license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) should be good enough. I'm not sure about a BY-NC-SA license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/): I have to find this out with my lawyers (i.e. me or whoever has a good suggestion).
